# Assignment 4
## Vanilla Recurrent Neural Network 

Dataset:  The Goblet of Fire by J.K. Rowling.
    - The txt file of the book should be put under the directory of ```./Dataset/JK-Rowling```.

In this assignment, A Vanilla Recurrent Neural Network is applied. 



## Adagrad and RMSprop

In this assignment, we applied two optimizers: adagrad and RMSprop. One can choose it using ` --optimizer`

## Sequence Length

One can set the sequence length using `--seq_len`       

## hidden state
hidden state is set in `--m`.


## Learning Rate

### cyclical learning rates

`--lr` is learning rate on argparser.



## Note

The performance of this assignment is not as good as the matlab version. The model converges in a relatively high loss very soon compared to the matlab version. I assume that there might be some bug in my code.If you find anything wrong in my code, please let me know, thank you very much.
